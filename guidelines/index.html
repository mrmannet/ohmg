<h1>Guidelines</h1>
<p>Posted on 2020-11-25 on OH.MG.</p>
<br>
<p>Greetings Internaute!</p>
<br>
<p>You may or may not be aware that OH.MG / MMN, not only is a BBS we do many other things to, if you&#39;re interested see www.oh.mg for details. This BBS is run as a personal hobby and is not connected to the business side of things, so to make things a bit clear that I spend my own $$ on running this.</p>
<br>
<p>For this reason, please don&#39;t abuse the system, it&#39;s my long time baby and it ruins it for everybody. </p>
<br>
<h2>Personal Interactions </h2>
<br>
<p>I know that not everybody has to like each other, but we do have to be decent to each other and civil. Discourse is going to happen, arguments do occur, this is life. However, that being said, harassment, defamation, racism, sexism, homophobia and anything else that quantifies as « hate speech » will not be accepted on this board.</p>
<br>
<p>For clarity, we&#39;re not talking First Amendment stuff here, the board is Located in Paris and I&#39;m also based in Paris, France. As such, we have a line between what is Free Speech and Hate Speech, please do not cross it, I don&#39;t want to read it on my board and you&#39;ll be banned.</p>
<br>
<h2>Shared Resources</h2>
<br>
<p>I am a fond fan of certain projects, especially Individual.NET. For this reason I use their public access news server to pull our usenet feeds, but with any public service there are limits. The BBS as a whole can only post on this account, so by all means have interactions, just don&#39;t post garbage and prevent others from having a meaningful discussion. I would also highly recommend you check them out for a bit more info on their project.</p>
<br>
<p>Email is also a complicated beast, since this server is hosted on my home internet account, crossing that line is a bit of a problem. Therefore, only validated people will have outbound email access, there is no external SMTP or POP access. Sending and receiving emails is limited to within the BBS itself. Please note as well, since incoming email is SPAM filtered, you will not be able to receive anything until I manually approve the account.</p>
<br>
<p>I use SpamHero for the board&#39;s email, as you can probably imagine if we become a SPAM source, it will not go down well for me with them one bit. And of course, Free could easily pull the plug on my internet access.</p>
<br>
<h2>Security</h2>
<br>
<p>I try my best to keep everything locked down, email is transmitted via TLS and over an internal network from the BBS to the mail thrower machine, from there it&#39;s encrypted between that machine and the external smarthost, what happens next is anybody&#39;s guess. Same with incoming, it&#39;s encrypted from receipt to the BBS. But let me be very clear here, the software I run is from a different era, before people were shitty and Russians allegedly rigged elections. You&#39;re connecting over the least secure protocol available (telnet).</p>
<br>
<p>I seriously recommend NOT using a usual password, while I can verify the integrity of my database, I can&#39;t verify that your internet connection is not being snooped on.</p>
<br>
<p>Further to this and for total clarity, I can access all messages on the BBS, I don&#39;t go looking through them but should I be compelled to by a French Court, I won&#39;t have much of a choice.</p>
<br>
<h2>Jurisdiction</h2>
<br>
<p>I&#39;m thankfully nowhere near America, the server too is not based in the US, so your data is pretty much in a better condition than, say, on Facebook. Since this is not a business venture, technically I&#39;m not bound by GDPR but since I&#39;m not a total dick, I still apply those principals to how I manage what information you choose to give me. If you want anything changed, amended or removed, I will do this. I can only accept these kinds of requests from within your account or an email address linked to your account.</p>
<br>
<p>If you want to access, ammend, or remove any of your details contact Kevin on the BBS or ny-fiainana-manokana@labs.oh.mg from the email address your account was validated with.</p>
<br>
<h2>The Web via Groups.io</h2>
<br>
<p>I ask that you keep all topics within the subgroups, since there are members on various lists I brought in from other places I hosted them at, by posting in Main these subscribers might get emails that they don&#39;t expect or want. At the moment you can create topics in Main, but if it becomes an issue then I will set it to Annoucements Only.</p>
<br>
<p>Generally the posts you&#39;ll see in Main are policy based, urgent messages, and something that needs to be communicated or in some case discussed by the MMN community as a whole. For discussion posts, they will have the hashtag #comdiscuss.</p>
<br>
<p>If you would like to suggest a new conference (eg a new subgroup) let me know, 99,99% of the time I will accept, if I don&#39;t or can&#39;t then I&#39;ll explain why and happily discuss it with you. I&#39;m not a total dictator after all.</p>
<br>
<p>You can message me on the BBS as Kevin, SysOp Page or by Email : fitantanam-pitondrana@labs.oh.mg</p>
<br>
<p>If you have any questions though, just ask, if you&#39;d like something added to the BBS, I will happily give it a shot.</p>
